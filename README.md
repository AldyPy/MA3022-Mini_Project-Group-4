# Mini Project Kelompok 4

## How to run

### Create a virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
```

### Use virtual environment

If you're using **Windows Command Prompt**:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

If you're using **Windows Powershell**:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

If you're using **MacOS**:
```
.venv/Scripts/activate
```

If you're on **Linux**, well uhh you probably already know what to do heheh... but just in case:
```
.venv/Scripts/activate
```


### Install requirements
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Use the virtual env Python interpreter as your notebook kernel
Depends on what you're using, but there should be a button or setting (that is pretty obvious) to do this, try and search the internet if you can't find it

After that, you're all set and the notebook should be ready to run :)
